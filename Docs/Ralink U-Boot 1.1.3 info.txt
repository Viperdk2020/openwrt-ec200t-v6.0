Router/mtd0.bin:0x17540 shows it’s Ralink U-Boot 1.1.3 (Apr 02 2021) with JBoneCloud additions (HTTP updater strings, dual-slot prompts, LTE board name).

  - Strings around Router/mtd0.bin:0x19438 reveal the Image1/Image2 checks; on every boot it reads both slots, prints the magic/header/data verdicts, and copies Image1→Image2 when slot 2
    is corrupt.
  - Header magic is accepted only if it matches the vendor value baked into shipping images (see mtd6.bin:0x00), so any custom firmware must present the same 64-byte uImage header.

  Firmware Packet Layout

  - The outer header is a uImage with magic 0x27151967, standard CRC fields, load address 0x80000000, entry 0x80285de0, and data length 0x0064d091 (mtd6.bin:0x00). Recomputing CRC32 over
    the payload reproduces the stored dcrc (0x6b02634a), confirming there’s no hidden checksum.
  Default Environment / Recovery Paths

  - The baked-in environment at Router/mtd0.bin:0x1c9e0 sets bootcmd=tftp, bootdelay=1, serverip=192.168.188.103, ipaddr=192.168.188.1, so falling back to the boot menu drops you straight
    into the network upgrader unless you interrupt it.
    changing the magic. The data CRC must match the exact bytes written to flash; if it doesn’t, you’ll hit “Image1 Data Checksum --> Failed” on reboot.
  - After wrapping, confirm with python3 - <<'PY' … zlib.crc32(open(image,'rb').read()[0x40:]) … PY before flashing, then verify from the console that both “Header Checksum” and “Data
    Checksum” return OK before trusting the slot.
